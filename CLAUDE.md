## Commands

npm test && npm run lint

## Version Update Procedure

**IMPORTANT: Version updates and releases are fully automated via Semantic Release and GitHub Actions.**

### Automated Release Process

This project uses **Semantic Release** with **GitHub Actions** for fully automated versioning, changelog generation, and publishing.

#### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Trigger**: Push to `production` branch

**Automated Steps**:
1. **Semantic Release** analyzes commit messages and determines version bump
2. **Version Update**: Updates `package.json`, `src/webview/package.json`, `src/webview/package-lock.json`
3. **Changelog Generation**: Automatically updates `CHANGELOG.md`
4. **Git Commit**: Creates release commit with message `chore(release): ${version} [skip ci]`
5. **GitHub Release**: Creates GitHub release with release notes
6. **VSIX Build**: Builds and packages the extension
7. **VSIX Upload**: Uploads `.vsix` file to GitHub release
8. **Version Sync**: Merges version changes from `production` to `main` branch

#### Commit Message Convention (Conventional Commits)

The version bump is determined by commit message prefixes:

- `feat:` → **Minor** version bump (e.g., 2.0.0 → 2.1.0)
- `fix:` → **Patch** version bump (e.g., 2.1.0 → 2.1.1)
- `perf:` → **Patch** version bump
- `revert:` → **Patch** version bump
- **BREAKING CHANGE** in commit body → **Major** version bump (e.g., 2.1.0 → 3.0.0)
- `docs:`, `style:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:` → No release

**Example commit messages**:
```bash
feat: add MCP node integration
fix: resolve parameter validation issue
feat!: redesign workflow export format (BREAKING CHANGE)
```

#### Changelog Sections (`.releaserc.json`)

Generated changelog groups commits by type:

- **Features** (`feat:`)
- **Bug Fixes** (`fix:`)
- **Performance Improvements** (`perf:`)
- **Reverts** (`revert:`)
- **Code Refactoring** (`refactor:`) - visible
- **Documentation** (`docs:`) - visible
- **Styles** (`style:`) - hidden
- **Tests** (`test:`) - hidden
- **Build System** (`build:`) - hidden
- **Continuous Integration** (`ci:`) - hidden
- **Miscellaneous Chores** (`chore:`) - hidden

#### Automated File Updates

Semantic Release automatically updates:
- `package.json` (root)
- `src/webview/package.json`
- `src/webview/package-lock.json`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

These files are committed with `[skip ci]` to prevent infinite loops.

#### Manual Version Updates (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**DO NOT manually update version numbers unless absolutely necessary.**

If manual update is required:
1. Update `package.json` (root directory) - `"version"` field
2. Update `src/webview/package.json` - `"version"` field
3. Run `cd src/webview && npm install` to update `package-lock.json`
4. Commit all three files together

Manual version updates will be overwritten by the next automated release.

## AI-Assisted Skill Node Generation (Feature 001-ai-skill-generation)

### Key Files and Components

#### Extension Host Services
- **src/extension/services/skill-relevance-matcher.ts**
  - Calculates relevance scores between user descriptions and Skills using keyword matching
  - `tokenize()`: Removes stopwords, filters by min length (3 chars)
  - `calculateSkillRelevance()`: Formula: `score = |intersection| / sqrt(|userTokens| * |skillTokens|)`
  - `filterSkillsByRelevance()`: Filters by threshold (0.6), limits to 20, prefers project scope
  - No new library dependencies (per user constraint)

- **src/extension/commands/ai-generation.ts** (Enhanced)
  - Scans personal + project Skills in parallel (`Promise.all`)
  - Filters Skills by relevance to user description
  - Constructs AI prompt with "Available Skills" section (JSON format)
  - Resolves `skillPath` post-generation for AI-generated Skill nodes
  - Marks missing Skills as `validationStatus: 'missing'`

- **src/extension/utils/validate-workflow.ts** (Extended)
  - `validateSkillNode()`: Validates required fields, name format, length constraints
  - Error codes: SKILL_MISSING_FIELD, SKILL_INVALID_NAME, SKILL_NAME_TOO_LONG, etc.
  - Integrated into `validateAIGeneratedWorkflow()` flow

#### Resources
- **resources/workflow-schema.json** (Updated)
  - Added Skill node type documentation (~1.5KB addition)
  - Instructions for AI: "Use when user description matches Skill's purpose"
  - Field descriptions: name, description, scope, skillPath (auto-resolved), validationStatus
  - File size: 16.5KB (within tolerance)

### Message Flow
```
Webview (AiGenerationDialog)
  → postMessage(GENERATE_WORKFLOW)
  → Extension (ai-generation.ts)
  → scanAllSkills() + loadWorkflowSchema() (parallel)
  → filterSkillsByRelevance(userDescription, availableSkills)
  → constructPrompt(description, schema, filteredSkills)
  → ClaudeCodeService.executeClaudeCodeCLI()
  → Parse & resolveSkillPaths(workflow, availableSkills)
  → Validate (including Skill nodes)
  → postMessage(GENERATION_SUCCESS | GENERATION_FAILED)
  → Webview (workflow-store.addGeneratedWorkflow())
```

### Key Constraints
- Max 20 Skills in AI prompt (prevent timeout)
- Relevance threshold: 0.3 (30%) - tested 0.5 but 0.3 provides better recall without sacrificing quality
- Keyword matching: O(n+m) complexity
- Duplicate handling: Project scope preferred over personal
- Generation timeout: 90 seconds

### Error Handling
- Skill not found → `validationStatus: 'missing'`
- Skill file malformed → `validationStatus: 'invalid'`
- All errors logged to "Claude Code Workflow Studio" Output Channel

### Design Decisions & Lessons Learned

**Phase 5 (User Skill Selection) - Rejected**

During development, we attempted to implement a UI feature allowing users to manually select which Skills to include/exclude in AI generation. This was intended to prevent timeouts when users have many Skills installed.

**Why it was rejected:**
- **AI generation control has inherent limitations**: The AI prompt is a "suggestion" not a "command"
- **Unpredictable behavior**: Even when Skills are excluded from the prompt, the AI may still generate Skill nodes based on its own interpretation of the user's description
- **Poor UX**: Users selecting "don't use this Skill" would experience confusion when the AI uses it anyway
- **Uncontrollable AI behavior**: The final decision of which nodes to generate belongs to the AI, not the prompt engineering

**Key lesson:**
> Do not implement user-facing features that promise control over AI behavior that cannot be guaranteed. AI generation is inherently probabilistic, and features requiring deterministic outcomes should be avoided.

**Alternative approaches for timeout prevention:**
- Dynamic timeout adjustment based on Skill count
- Adaptive relevance threshold tuning (e.g., 0.3 → 0.5 for high Skill counts)
- Maintain strict MAX_SKILLS_IN_PROMPT limit (currently 20)
